From [Quora - What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-data-mining-or-machine-learning-algorithms/answer/Xavier-Amatriain)

> If I were interviewing you for a Data Mining position what would be the top 10 algorithms I would expect you to know in order of priority?

1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. k-means
4. SVMs
5. Random Forests
6. Matrix Factorization/SVD
7. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Machines
8. Naive Bayes
9. Artificial Neural Networks

>For the last one I'd let you pick one of the following:

- Bayesian Networks
- Elastic Nets
- Any other clustering algo besides k-means
- LDA
- Conditional Random Fields
- HDPs or other Bayesian non-parametric model
