1. Be confident in your skills, and don’t let other people’s comments negatively affect your performance.
2. Value the expertise of others, but don’t shy away from being the leader.
3. Be a leader, but don’t over-exert your authority.
4. Be “real” with your team, and don’t claim expertise you don’t have.
5. Share your vision, but ask for the input and feedback from others.
6. Manage with compassion, but don’t be afraid to address issues.
7. Learn everything you can about how to be a people manager, and use your HR department as your career development partner.
