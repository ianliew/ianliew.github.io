Key takeaways from yesterday's MBS' Talking Data Speaker Series by [Dr Khan](https://www.atkearney.com/analytics/khalid-khan) from A.T. Kearney.

## Organisations deploy analytics for one of the two reasons

1. To validate pre-existing hypothesis (laggards / followers)
2. To input into their strategy, integrate with existing decision making process (leaders / explorers)

Shift from descriptive, to predictive, to prescriptive analytics and insights

## Organisations deploy analytics in one of the two ways

1. Start-up Model - demand driven; prototyping or piloting small projects and eventually grow into a bigger piece; often more successful
2. Field of Dreams Model - supply driven; big bang deployment of architecture and rapidly grow talent and capabilities; not so successful

Either of the two will require top level endorsement, typical C-level, that requires bottom line answers rather than tech jargon.

## But the problem _<small>implementing an analytically powered organisation</small>_

The problem is not:

- Data - Data is easy to identify and acquire (purchasing)
- Technology - Technology is easy to deploy, infrastructure is easy to setup

The problem is the TALENT - the link between business, technology and analytics (the **trilingual**) to use the information to shape answers within business context to translate value into the organisation.

## Key to an Analytically Powered Organisation

- DATA - the USE of data needs to have business sense
- TECHNOLOGY - needs to be fit for purpose (while prototyping)
- TALENT - needs the tri-linguist
- CULTURE - sponsors from above, build COEs, advocate use of analytics to drive business outcomes
