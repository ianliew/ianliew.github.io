> If you've worked all the way through this course, you should now consider yourself an expert in Machine Learning

Probably not make that claim yet... But it's been an interesting journey. To recap...

1. Signed up with Coursera on June 23rd but did nothing with it
2. Enrolled in this critically acclaimed ML course by Andrew Ng
3. Digging up fragmented memories of linear algebra and calculus which fortunately have only been tucked away and not conveniently forgotten
4. First real Linear Regression assignment on Week 2 - completed 8 Aug
5. As [Ronald](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hard-ronald-widha-sunarno) put it - got slammed hard by Neural Networks assignment on Week 5 - completed 30 Aug
6. Sped through the rest of the content and finishing the course 2.5 weeks later

And the results:

## So, What Have I Learnt?

**Supervised Learning** - linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines.

**Unsupervised Learning** - k-means, principal component analysis, anomaly detection

**Special Applications** - recommender system, large scale machine learning (map-reduce / on-line learning)

**Building a ML System** - bias/ variances, regularization, evaluate learning algorithms, learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis
