As [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) puts it, “competitive advantage occurs when an organization acquires or develops an attribute or combination of attributes that allows it to outperform its competitors.”

These attributes can be grouped into 4 categories:

1. They are **size related**. For example, economies of scale / experience curve / network effect
2. Gaining **market power** from the effect of a brand
3. Access to **scare or valuable resources** like natural resources / technology (patented and cannot be copied) / unique distribution channel
4. Or something that is less quantifiable - **core competencies**, which is by having better people (resourced based) / better coordination (organisation) / working smarter (processes), *not the same as experience curve*

The next time you think of a company that is doing well (could be your company), think in terms of the above categories. What is your competitive advantage? Are you really doing better? Remember, it is not a competitive advantage if it is not hard to copy.
