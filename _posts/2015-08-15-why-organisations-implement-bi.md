The typical Google answer / marketing quotes from a BI tool brochure would probably say ...

- To facilitate better decision making
- To improve operational efficiency
- To grow revenue
- To increase competitive advantage
- To enhance customer services
- etc, etc, etc...

While it may be true that an organisation could potentially achieve at least one or more of the items above, but many don't and these project gets branded as *yet another failed IT project*. So what went wrong?

Perhaps instead of selling what BI tools have helped others achieved, a more relevant answer and focus should be on what problem the organisation is facing and what area BI tools can assist in, which is ...

1. To allow reports to be created more easily
2. To allow reports to be consumed, shared and collaborated
3. To have governance on data and reports, and allow infrastructure to be scaled and extended

This also highlights the difference between ***Business Intelligence*** and ***Advance Analytics***.

Simply installing a software will not solve your problems, mate!
